# MauiApp1

Its a simple app to test out things and functions (not tested on iOS yet), which i think will be useful for my own purposes. Other function testing will be done in another repo.
I plan to move all the function from the predecessor Xamarin TestCourseApp, as the support from Xamarin will be stopped after November 2023.
Current functionality in the app:
- Notes from doc.microsoft (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/tutorials/notes-app/)
- Simple calculator (still a bit scuff)
- Currency converter for IDR, USD, and JPY with Exchange Rates Data API (https://apilayer.com/marketplace/exchangerates_data-api?live_demo=show)
